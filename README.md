> **Warning**: This documentation was generated by ChatGPT.

## Overview

`extremum.py` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that returns the local minima and maxima of a specified column in a CSV file. The output is provided in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
  "min": [max indices],
  "max": [min indices]
}
```

## Installation

This tool requires Python and the following Python libraries: `pandas`, `typer`, `numpy`, and `json`. You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas typer numpy
```

## Usage

To use `extremum.py`, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:

```bash
python extremum.py [OPTIONS] DATA
```

### Arguments

- `DATA`: The CSV file to be processed. This is a required argument.

### Options

- `--column`: The name of the column to consider. If not specified, the first column of the CSV file will be used.
- `--radius`: The radius to consider for local minima and maxima. Default is `5`.
- `--use-edges` / `--no-use-edges`: A boolean flag to include or exclude edges as potential minima or maxima. By default, this is set to `False`, meaning edges will not be considered.

## Examples

To find the local minima and maxima of the 'Sales' column in a file named 'data.csv', with a radius of 10 and including edges, you would use the following command:

```bash
python extremum.py --column Sales --radius 10 --use-edges data.csv
```
